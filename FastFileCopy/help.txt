	Move/Copy              integer    Default = 1(Copy)
	MaxDegreeOfParallelism integer    Default = 10

E.g., Copy everything from temp1 to temp2 using 10 threads including subdirectories and store console output to log.txt

	 "C:\temp1" "C:\temp2" > log.txt

E.g., Move every .xml file from temp1 to temp2 using 500 threads including subdirectories and store console output to log.txt

	 "C:\temp1" "C:\temp2" 0 500 1 5 "*.xml" 1 > log.txt

E.g., Move every .xml file from temp2 to temp1 using 200 threads top directory only and don't log at all

	 "C:\temp2" "C:\temp1" 0 200 0 5 "*.xml" 0


Note: Abort is how many checksum mismatches are allowed of an up to 0.25MB piece of a file before giving up on that file (with a 100ms delay).
