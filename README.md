# FastFileCopy

This is a C# console application that performs a fast file copy or move operation. The application takes command line arguments as input, including source and destination file paths, and various options for controlling the operation such as whether to copy or move files, the level of parallelism, logging options, and others. The application also has a built-in help feature that can be accessed by passing the "?" argument. Overall, it is designed to perform the file operation as fast as possible by using parallel processing and other performance optimization techniques.

The application uses various C# libraries such as ByteSizeLib, ListShuffle, and xxHash3 to perform the file operations.
